**Submission to Engineering Applications of Artificial Intelligence.**

This implementation of EEEA-Net (Early Exit Evolutionary Algorithm Network) from EEEA-Net: An Early Exit Evolutionary Neural Architecture Search by [Chakkrit Termritthikun](https://chakkritte.github.io/cv/), et al.

**This code is based on the implementation of  [DARTS](https://github.com/quark0/darts), [NSGA-Net](https://github.com/ianwhale/nsga-net), [NSGA-Net-v2](https://github.com/mikelzc1990/nsganetv2), [Once for All](https://github.com/mit-han-lab/once-for-all), and [TransferLearning-Tasks](https://github.com/EMI-Group/TransferLearning-Tasks).**
